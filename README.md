# ExamProject
Programming exam project in highshool 2020

Requires 2-4 controllers to play. First connected controller is the theif, and all others are catchers

Theif is invisible, unless the player holds down the A button. They can grab objects around them to drag them out

Catchers must catch the theif to win

Theif must steal everything to win (theif win not implemented)

Janky physics are intentional to some degree
